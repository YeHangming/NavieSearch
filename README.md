Search engines play an essential role on the Internet. Many users depend on search engines by entering keywords to look for information they want. However, the experience for users may not always be good, as there can be a lot of advertisements for the results of some keywords. Sometimes the majority of results can be advertisements instead of the information a user wants. The situation even worsened for all the search engines when they asked users to download their search and community applications. Motivated by this phenomenon, this Simple Search application is designed to improve user experiences of search engines.

There already exist applications that share the aim with this app, "Startpage"and "Adblock", for example. However, those are web applications that mainly focus on personal computers and only focus on a single search engine. In the mobile platform, rarely an application could be found to satisfy the following features:

1. Combined search of multiple search engine

2. Remove advertisements

3. Prevent cookie tracking to protect privacy

The Simple Search application relies on the search services provided by search engines. It firstly gets the search results from the search engine chosen by users. By removing the advertisements and tracking, it displays the pure results to users. 

There are some reasons why this app can attract mobile phone users. Firstly, users only need one application to finish the combined search without switching the application. Furthermore, the application provides an excellent experience by removing advertisements, redirection and cookie tracking. Lastly, this app also provides statistics, language and theme switching to enhance usability.
